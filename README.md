# solana-taxtoken

This repository provides a program to manage the distribution of token rewards by withdrawing transfer fees from all holders of a deployed mint token on Solana. It integrates with Raydium for swapping fees into Solana (SOL) and distributing the rewards. The program is designed for maximum configurability, supporting multiple reward tokens, adjustable swap fees, and custom distribution intervals.
